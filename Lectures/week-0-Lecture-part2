Compression Algorithm :
There are complex algorithms with which the output can be faster and have a lot of impact on today's economy.
For example, Google hangouts which helps in sending and receiving live audio and video.

Google hangouts use audio and video compression algorithms to transmit live  audio and video across the
internet. Video compression is the technique used to prepare video in order to transport it over the internet
and to deliver it to various kinds of video players. High quality means large file size, small file size means
lower quality. Compression is always a compromise between the file size and quality.

Codec is a compression algorithm. The word codec stands for compression - decompression. It is used to
compress the video information on one end using an encoding program and decompress it at the other end
for playback. Compression algorithms achieve compression by replacing repeated occurrences of data with
references to a single copy of these existing earlier in the input data stream. Basically it's a piece
of software that makes your video readable by your computer and allows you to play it. Without codec we
cannot play a video file.

The transmission of audio and video signals requires a network with large bandwidth. The reduction of
the required bandwidth and memory space, while maintaining high audio and video quality, can be achieved
by compression algorithms. Recent advances in computer technology have significant improvements in compression
algorithms. Also, there is growing need to transfer large amount of data over the network. Hence, the
compression algorithms have a significant economic impact related to various storage media or better
utilization of network connections.
