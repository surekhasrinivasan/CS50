CS50 Week 5 Discussions

1. Discuss HTTP and the creation of the web. Do some research on ARPANET and be ready to discuss
something you found about it.

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol for transferring the hypertext pages from Web Server
to Web Browser. For exchanging web pages between Server and Browser, an HTTP session is setup using
protocol methods (e.g. GET, POST etc.). HTTP used by the World Wide Web to define how messages are
formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to various
commands.

For example, when you enter a URL in your browser, this actually sends an HTTP command to the Web
server redirecting it to fetch and transmit the requested Web page. The other main standard that
controls how the World Wide Web works is HTML, which covers how Web pages are formatted and displayed.

HTTP specifies exactly how one must make a request for a web page and exactly how a server, a machine
that hosts web pages, delivers that information back to clients.

There are HTTP status codes which are response codes given by Web servers and help identify the cause
of the problem. For example, "404 File Not Found" is a common HTTP status code. It means the Web server
cannot find the file you requested. This means the webpage or other document tried to load in your Web
browser has either been moved or deleted, or you entered the wrong URL.

Knowing the meaning of the HTTP status code can help you figure out what went wrong. On a 404 error,
for example, you could look at the URL to see if a word looks misspelled, then correct it and try it
again. If that doesn't work, backtrack by deleting information between each backslash, until you come
to a page on that site that isn't a 404. From there you may be able to find the page you're looking for.

The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was the first wide area packet switching network
and the first network to implement the protocol suite TCP/IP. Both technologies became the technical
foundation of the Internet. So ARPANET was the network that became the basis for the Internet. The ARPANET
was initially funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of
Defense.

In 1969, the idea became a modest reality with the interconnection of four university computers in
southwestern US (UCLA, Stanford Research Institute, UCSB, and the University of Utah).
